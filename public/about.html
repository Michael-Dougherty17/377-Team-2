        <p>
          Students at UMD have a hard time getting used to the bus schedule when
          they first arrive. The bus apps offered to students are not intuitive
          and do not provide users with everything they need like trip length
          and arrival times. We hope to provide students with a simple and easy
          solution to get where they need to be on time. This app will help them
          manage schedules better and know when they will arrive at their
          destinations.The user would enter their starting and ending
          destinations into the app. Next, using data from the API, the app will
          show which bus routes are available to them and when those buses will
          arrive at their current stop. Once a bus has been selected, the app
          will display how long it will take to get to their destination. We
          will use the UMD.io API to access bus route information. This API
          holds the data like bus stops, route times, and bus numbers, which are
          all necessary to solve the information problem.
