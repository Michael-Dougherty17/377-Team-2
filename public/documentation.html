          To get data from the API we used an async function and retrieved an
          array of bus routes and bus stops. Then using a PUT method we called
          the api again with user data from the form. Once the API has been
          called again using user input, we use a POST method to retrieve the
          final data from the API by calling it a third time with the data
          retrieved the second time. After the final data has been retrieved
          from the API we send it back to the front end to show the user what
          they need to know.

          The main bug with the application currently is displaying information
          to the user from the API. Our team was unable to solve this problem
          and that is the main compenonet hindering further development. Once
          this issue is resolved, developers can impplement planned future
          features such as a live map interface shows where a bus on a route is,
          the saving of frequently used routes, a scheduling system that can
          notify users when buses are arriving at stops, and an alert systemt
          aht notifies users of late buses.
