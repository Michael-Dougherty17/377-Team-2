# Terpbus

## README
Students at UMD have a hard time getting used to the bus schedule when
they first arrive. The bus apps offered to students are not intuitive
and do not provide users with everything they need like trip length
and arrival times. We hope to provide students with a simple and easy
solution to get where they need to be on time. This app will help them
manage schedules better and know when they will arrive at their
destinations.

## Developer Manual

The audience of this document is future developers who will take over your system.
They know technical terms and have general knowledge about web applications, but do not have knowledge about your system design.
You need to provide a technical document so that future developers can start setting up the application on their local machines, and keep working on the system development after you leave the team.
Your Developer Manual covers:
How to install your application and all dependencies
How to run your application on a server
How to run any tests you have written for your software
The API for your server application - all GET, POST, PUT, etc endpoints, and what they each do
A clear set of expectations around known bugs and a road-map for future development.
