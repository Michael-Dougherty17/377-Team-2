# Terpbus

## README
Students at UMD have a hard time getting used to the bus schedule when
they first arrive. The bus apps offered to students are not intuitive
and do not provide users with everything they need like trip length
and arrival times. We hope to provide students with a simple and easy
solution to get where they need to be on time. This app will help them
manage schedules better and know when they will arrive at their
destinations.

### Bugs and Future Development
The main bug with the application currently is displaying information to the user from the API. Our team was unable to solve this problem and that is the main compenonet hindering further development. Once this issue is resolved, developers can impplement planned future features such as a live map interface shows where a bus on a route is, the saving of frequently used routes, a scheduling system that can notify users when buses are arriving at stops, and an alert systemt aht notifies users of late buses.
