Title: TerpBus

Team members: Shasvat Vyas, Michael Dougherty, Ulrich Boudie, Swapnil Goplani

Link to where your app is running:  https://quiet-hollows-47732.herokuapp.com/

Information problem you're trying to solve: Due to the fact that new students at UMD have a hard time getting used to the bus schedule because the current apps are neither intuitive enough nor do they provide them(students) with every thing they need, we aim to put in place a new bus app whixh will solve all these issues.

Identified stakeholders/target browsers: Our target browsers are nely admitted students into the University of Maryland.

Data you chose to work with: For our app, we have chosen to work with the data provided from the umd API's. 

Chosen strategies and solutions for the problem: 




Technical system decision rationale:

For technical aspects in our project, we used Bulma to customize our HTML pages. We used navbar feature to create a navigation  bar at the top of the page. We also have a burger drop down menu hen the screen is on a mobile interface. For back-end programming, we used node.js. Data was passed from the API through our website in structured in a JSON format which is fetched from the UMD.io API when the page loads. We used the column feature to create the CSS columns in our CSS for the destination and the route information sections. 

How/if your final system helps to address the problem:

Challenges faced and impact on final design: We have failed to get the bus data working on our app, which has made it unable to display the bus number, routes, and departures/arrival times.

Possible future work directions with this problem:

Next steps that we will take to further this project in the future are develop a live map interface to show students where exactly their bus is when they are using the app. This will allow the users to save their favorite routes. We will also create a scheduling system that notifies users when their favorite bus is arriving at their local stop but also notify them by sending alerts when their favorite buses are running late.
